# python-image-manipulator<br />
This was the final project for SFU CMPT 120.

It is a simple python image editor, which takes a jpg image and performs operations on all of the pixels to create a filter. It also contains a 'computer vision' component which tracks a fish (included in the repo) based on its hvs components

You can find the demo [here](https://replit.com/@crazycactus99/FinalProject#main.py)

If you want to execute the program on desktop, make sure that Pygame is installed in your system, and then run the 'main' executable, or run main.py from a code editor.
